# Introduction
Small library project featuring newly learned knowledge about JavaScript object constructors.

It is a part of The Odin project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library

# Functionality
- Displaying list of books in a table
- Adding new books via modal dialog
- Additional functionality - pager

# Reflection
Important topics learned/practiced:

- object constructors
- prototype inheritance
- data-* attribute
- dialog
- tables
- processing forms data
- simple custom table pager

Although adding pager wasn't an objective of this project I felt like it just fits here.
That's why I implemented it.
